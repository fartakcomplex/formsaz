Current Project Status Assessment:
- Application is fully functional with no JS errors
- 5 views working correctly with smooth navigation
- CRUD operations working (create, read, update, delete forms)
- Form submission and analytics working
- Template gallery with 8 real templates
- Theme customization with 8 color options
- Clean ESLint - no warnings or errors

Unresolved Issues / Recommendations for Next Phase:
1. The results-view.tsx could benefit from more chart types (pie charts, radar charts)
2. Dark mode support needs testing - theme system is set up but not actively toggleable
3. Drag-and-drop reordering of questions is not yet implemented (currently using up/down in properties panel)
4. Image choice question type is listed but not yet implemented in the renderer
5. Matrix question type is listed but needs implementation
6. Form sharing/copy link functionality is a placeholder
7. Could add form duplication feature in dashboard
8. Could add batch delete/select multiple forms
9. File upload is UI-only (no actual file handling backend)
10. Could add form expiration/closing date feature
